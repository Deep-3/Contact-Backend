/* There can be many many api's for which we would need to write functions bundling them all in a single file can be problamatic in the long run 
therefore to overcome this issue we can write all our functions in a new file and simply call a function app.use()
app.use takes two argument 
1st : a base uri address ex : /contacts , now everytime our server gets a request starting with /contacts '/...' something something our app.use function will redirect us to our 2nd argument 
2nd : route object, we will create a new js file and create a route object there and import in our current js file and pass the route object as the 2nd argument

the js file where route object was declared will have all the functions such as .get, .post ... which will be called accordingly depending on the request URI

app.use() is used to define middleware as the callback function in our case the callback functions are part of the router object
